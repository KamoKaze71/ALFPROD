Installing Hotfixes
-------------------

Unzip the C1.Web.C1WebGrid.dll to the <installdir>\bin folder. 

If the .zip file contains new client side java script (client\v1_*) then
you should unzip them to the <installdir>\c1webgrid folder.

Remove the following assemblies from the GAC:

C1.Web.C1WebGrid.dll

Install the new dlls you just put in the <installdir>\bin into
the GAC (this step is optional, not recommended).

To install the assemblies into the GAC:

*  Open the Visual Studio .NET Command prompt and cd into the
   <installdir>\bin folder.

   Type "gacutil /if c1.web.c1webgrid.dll" at the command prompt. This will install
   the assemblies into the GAC.

OR

*  You can use Windows Explorer and drag the assemblies into the GAC.

Restart IIS.

License nag
-----------

If the assembly version of C1.Web.C1WebGrid.dll has changed you'll most likely
get the evaluation nag screen when rebuilding your application.  This is a result
of the the assembly having a strong name.  The easiest way to alleviate the problem
is by changing a property of the grid, this should update the license.licx file.

Intellisense
------------

If you would like to have Intellisense in HTML view you should place c1webgrid.xsd into
your <VS installdir>\common7\packages\schemas\xml folder.  Add the following xmlns:c1webgrid
element on any page in which you want Intellisense:

<body xmlns:c1webgrid="urn:http://www.componentone.com/schemas/c1webgrid">
